// TROUBLESHOOTING PRACTICE INSTRUCTIONS
/** 
 * Look at the todo statements written at the top of each file (if there is one)
 * Keep working through each of the tasks until you have none left
 * Let a veteran know when you're done with your code :>
 * First person to correct all of the code wins (bragging rights i guess LOL)
 * 
 * It's generally recommended to work through the errors with the red lines because those are 
 * more critical errors, but there are a few errors that are related to logic that wouldn't
 * produce the results we want. 
 * 
 * You'll also be writing some code, though don't worry because they're relatively easy to write.
 * 
 * Check for any missing imports, conditional statement logic, typos, capitalization issues, 
 * difference between public and private variables, AKA the stuff we've gone over in past meetings
 * whenever we had an error.
 * 
 * Good luck and ask questions if you don't understand something!! Please don't just copy what 
 * someone else did just because it works. (That defeats the whole purpose of us spending time
 * to do this ðŸ’€)

 * TODO: there are 2 errors in this file (look for the red squiggly lines)
